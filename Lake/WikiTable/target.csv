"Kevin Bartlett ""Put his unique stamp on the 1980 finals series , kicking 21 goals as a half-forward in Richmond's three appearances, including a Grand Final-equalling bag of seven in the Grand Final massacre of the Magpies , which earned him the Norm Smith Medal for being best afield.""","Royce Hart ""Thrilled Tiger fans for a decade with his match-winning exploits at centre half-forward. His dominance up forward was a major factor in the Club's run of four premierships from 1967–74. He was an extraordinary mark, a deadeye shot for goal, very courageous and, when the ball hit the ground, he swooped on it like a rover.""","Jack Dyer ""No player in the history of the game epitomises his club more than the man known as 'Captain Blood'. He struck fear into the hearts and minds of all opposition players during the 1930s and 40s. Was renowned for his bone-jarring shirtfronts, which left many an opponent bloodied, battered and bruised. He bled for the Tigers and expected his teammates to do likewise.""","Save Our Skins ""On 15 August 1990, Richmond announced that it needed to raise $1 million by 31 October that year, or it would cease to exist. The Save Our Skins campaign was immediately established to keep the Tigers alive. With Club president Neville Crowe as the figurehead, the SOS campaign did exactly what it set out to achieve, raising the necessary funds to stave off the threat of extinction.""","Graeme Richmond ""Graeme Richmond filled a variety of important roles at Tigerland over more than 30 years of devoted service. He was a shrewd, ruthless administrator, who never wasted an opportunity that could benefit his beloved Tigers. His strength lay in his relentless persuasiveness—he was a masterly recruiter and negotiator. And, as a speaker, arguably there have been none finer in league football history.""","Francis Bourke ""Bourke collided with teammate Stephen Mount in a tense Round 21, 1980 clash with North Melbourne at Arden Street and had trouble seeing because of the blood streaming down his face. He was subsequently moved from full-back to the opposite end of the ground, where he immediately made his presence felt, taking a diving chest mark and slotting through a crucial goal.""","1967 ""Richmond, under coach Tommy Hafey , finished the 1967 home-and-away season on top. The Tigers disposed of Carlton by 40 points in the second-semi, then faced up to a star-studded Geelong combination in the Grand Final . At the end of a spectacular contest, Richmond had broken a 24-year premiership drought. Barrot , Brown , Hart , Dean and Bartlett starred, while unsung hero Ronaldson kicked three vital goals.""","Michael Roach ""The superstar full-forward was a noted high-flyer during his 200-game career at Tigerland, but the mark he took against Hawthorn at the MCG in 1979 was, almost literally, out of this world. 'Roachy' actually rose so high over a huge nest of Hawk players, he ended up making it a chest mark!""","Michael Mitchell ""The little Tiger excitement machine decided to take off on a bit of a trot during the team's final home-and-away match of the 1990 season , against Sydney at the SCG . After gathering the ball deep in defence, 'Mitch' took one bounce, then another, and then five more (seven in total), before calmly drilling home an incredibly inspirational goal.""","Windy Hill Brawl ""On 18 May 1974, all hell broke loose at half-time of Richmond's clash with Essendon at Windy Hill as the players were leaving the field . . . A massive brawl erupted, involving players and officials of both clubs. Following a league investigation, several players and officials received suspensions, the heaviest being for Graeme Richmond , who was rubbed out until 31 December and also fined $2000."""

Diode,Silicon-controlled rectifier (SCR),Thyristor,Gate turn-off thyristor (GTO),Triac,Bipolar junction transistor (BJT),Power MOSFET,Insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT),MOS-controlled thyristor (MCT),Integrated gate-commutated thyristor (IGCT)
"Uni-polar, uncontrolled, switching device used in applications such as rectification and circuit directional current control. Reverse voltage blocking device, commonly modeled as a switch in series with a voltage source, usually 0.7VDC. The model can be enhanced to include a junction resistance, in order to accurately predict the diode voltage drop across the diode with respect to current flow.","This semi-controlled device turns on when a gate pulse is present and the anode is positive compared to the cathode. When a gate pulse is present, the device operates like a standard diode. When the anode is negative compared to the cathode, the device turns off and blocks positive or negative voltages present. The gate voltage does not allow the device to turn off.","The thyristor is a family of three-terminal devices that include SCRs, GTOs, and MCT. For most of the devices, a gate pulse turns the device on. The device turns off when the anode voltage falls below a value (relative to the cathode) determined by the device characteristics. When off, it is considered a reverse voltage blocking device.","The gate turn-off thyristor, unlike an SCR, can be turned on and off with a gate pulse. One issue with the device is that turn off gate voltages are usually larger and require more current than turn on levels. This turn off voltage is a negative voltage from gate to source, usually it only needs to be present for a short time, but the magnitude s on the order of 1/3 of the anode current. A snubber circuit is required in order to provide a usable switching curve for this device. Without the snubber circuit, the GTO cannot be used for turning inductive loads off. These devices, because of developments in IGCT technology are not very popular in the power electronics realm. They are considered controlled, uni-polar and bi-polar voltage blocking.","The triac is a device that is essentially an integrated pair of phase-controlled thyristors connected in inverse-parallel on the same chip. Like an SCR, when a voltage pulse is present on the gate terminal, the device turns on. The main difference between an SCR and a Triac is that both the positive and negative cycle can be turned on independently of each other, using a positive or negative gate pulse. Similar to an SCR, once the device is turned on, the device cannot be turned off. This device is considered bi-polar and reverse voltage blocking.","The BJT cannot be used at high power; they are slower and have more resistive losses when compared to MOSFET type devices. To carry high current, BJTs must have relatively large base currents, thus these devices have high power losses when compared to MOSFET devices. BJTs along with MOSFETs, are also considered unipolar and do not block reverse voltage very well, unless installed in pairs with protection diodes. Generally, BJTs are not utilized in power electronics switching circuits because of the I 2 R losses associated with on resistance and base current requirements. BJTs have lower current gains in high power packages, thus requiring them to be set up in Darlington configurations in order to handle the currents required by power electronic circuits. Because of these multiple transistor configurations, switching times are in the hundreds of nanoseconds to microseconds. Devices have voltage ratings which max out around 1500V and fairly high current ratings. They can also be paralleled in order to increase power handling, but must be limited to around 5 devices for current sharing.","The main benefit of the power MOSFET is that the base current for BJT is large compared to almost zero for MOSFET gate current. Since the MOSFET is a depletion channel device, voltage, not current, is necessary to create a conduction path from drain to source. The gate does not contribute to either drain or source current. Turn on gate current is essentially zero with the only power dissipated at the gate coming during switching. Losses in MOSFETs are largely attributed to on-resistance. The calculations show a direct correlation to drain source on-resistance and the device blocking voltage rating, BV dss . Switching times range from tens of nanoseconds to a few hundred microseconds, depending on the device. MOSFET drain source resistances increase as more current flows through the device. As frequencies increase the losses increase as well, making BJTs more attractive. Power MOSFETs can be paralleled in order to increase switching current and therefore overall switching power. Nominal voltages for MOSFET switching devices range from a few volts to a little over 1000V, with currents up to about 100A or so. Newer devices may have higher operational characteristics. MOSFET devices are not bi-directional, nor are they reverse voltage blocking. ||","These devices have the best characteristics of MOSFETs and BJTs. Like MOSFET devices, the insulated gate bipolar transistor has a high gate impedance, thus low gate current requirements. Like BJTs, this device has low on state voltage drop, thus low power loss across the switch in operating mode. Similar to the GTO, the IGBT can be used to block both positive and negative voltages. Operating currents are fairly high, in excess of 1500A and switching voltage up to 3000V. The IGBT has reduced input capacitance compared to MOSFET devices which improves the Miller feedback effect during high dv/dt turn on and turn off.","The MOS-controlled thyristor is thyristor like and can be triggered on or off by a pulse to the MOSFET gate. Since the input is MOS technology, there is very little current flow, allowing for very low power control signals. The device is constructed with two MOSFET inputs and a pair of BJT output stages. Input MOSFETs are configured to allow turn on control during positive and negative half cycles. The output BJTs are configured to allow for bidirectional control and low voltage reverse blocking. Some benefits to the MCT are fast switching frequencies, fairly high voltage and medium current ratings (around 100A or so).","Similar to a GTO, but without the high current requirements to turn on or off the load. The IGCT can be used for quick switching with little gate current. The devices high input impedance largely because of the MOSFET gate drivers. They have low resistance outputs that don't waste power and very fast transient times that rival that of BJTs. ABB has published data sheets for these devices and provided descriptions of the inner workings. The device consists of a gate, with an optically isolated input, low on resistance BJT output transistors which lead to a low voltage drop and low power loss across the device at fairly high switching voltage and current levels. An example of this new device from ABB shows how this device improves on GTO technology for switching high voltage and high current in power electronics applications. According to ABB, the IGCT devices are capable of switching in excess of 5000VAC and 5000A at very high frequencies, something not possible to do efficiently with GTO devices."

Gargamel,"The main antagonist , Gargamel the sorcerer is the sworn enemy of the Smurfs. He is an evil wizard with limited powers. Gargamel is absolutely obsessed with the Smurfs and his main goal vacillates from trying to eat the Smurfs to trying to capture them to use in a potion to make gold . His robe is worn and patched, and his teeth are rotten.",Azrael,"Gargamel's pet cat . Although Gargamel never treats him well, Azrael manages to put up with his master. Azrael tends to realize beforehand that Gargamel's schemes will go awry, but reluctantly goes along with them anyway in hopes of possibly capturing a Smurf. Azrael shares Gargamel's distinctive laugh. Azrael was originally female in the comic books, but was changed to a male in the cartoon show and returned as a male in later comics and in the movie. In one episode of the series, Azrael got tired of Gargamel treating him so cruelly that he turned against his master. However in the movie, he still remains loyal to Gargamel.",Hogatha,"Hogatha is an evil, ugly witch who uses her magic in an attempt to lure unsuspecting suitors, and occasionally cause trouble for the Smurfs. Hogatha snorts loudly with her large Wart covered nose. She thinks she's beautiful, although she is actually quite ugly and wears a red wig to cover her baldness. She rides on a vulture. She and Gargamel dislike each other, and she refers to him as ""Garglesmell"". Hogatha used a spell to disguise herself as a Smurf who constantly snorts and causes trouble, under the name Snorty Smurf, in the first season episode ""The Fake Smurf"".",Balthazar is Gargamel's godfather . Balthazar despises the Smurfs and is actually more cold-hearted than Gargamel in addition to being a more powerful sorcerer . He lives in a large castle whose moat houses a fearsome dragon called a Moat Monster.,"Chlorhydris is an evil coldhearted sorceress , more powerful than Hogatha, who devotes her time to removing love from the world. A nasty, irredeemable woman as ugly as she is evil. It is revealed in the season 7 episode ""Chlorhydris' Lost Love"" that she was once kind and caring, but became hateful when her true love was stolen away from her. In The Tears Of A Smurf, she married a nobleman and had a daughter named Priscilla. Chlorhydris then became insanely jealous over her husband loving her daughter more than he loved her, leading to her causing her husband's death when Priscilla was a young toddler. Priscilla grew up in a castle without the love of her mother Chlorhydris, who was furious when a young prince fell in love with Priscilla, and used her maligant magic to cause the Prince's disappearance and put a curse of ugliness on Priscilla to keep anyone from falling in love with her.","Nemesis is a sinister , hiccupping creature shrouded in a purple robe. He is an evil wizard like Gargamel, only powerful. He is constantly trying to steal the Long-Life Stone, which is the magical artifact that grants the Smurfs their extremely long lifespans. He was once a human but after a magic accident, he became so grotesque that people are horrified at the sight of his face, so he keeps his hood over it.",Scrupule,Scruple is Gargamel's apprentice . Scruple was expelled from a wizard school and lives with his uncle Gargamel as kind of an indentured servant.,"Count Gregorian is an evil wizard who only appeared in the Season 2 episode ""The Raven Wizard"". He was originally thought to be Princess Savina's new tutor, but he became cursed where his head changes into that of a raven when the temporary spell to keep his human head wore off. He only wanted to transfer Savina's youth onto his face so that he could restore his human face. He failed when Peewit entered his castle and shattered the heart diamond, and the wizard turned into an entire raven. He is similar in trait to Gargamel in that they're both evil wizards and voiced by Paul Winchell.","Mordain is an evil wizard who solely appears in the Season 2 episode ""The Good, The Bad and The Smurfy"". He captured Papa Smurf, Smurfette, Clumsy Smurf and Brainy Smurf to entertain King Argon and his Knights on the King's birthday. When the other Smurfs entered the castle to free the captured Smurfs, Papa Smurf turned him into a frog , where he now spends his days eating flies. He is similar in trait to Gargamel and Count Gregorian in that they're evil wizards and voiced by Paul Winchell (though Count Gregorian and Mordain are not actually related to Gargamel).","The Wartmongers are little toad -like creatures who live in the muck and slime of Creepy Deepy Swamp and often cause the Smurfs problems. They consider having more warts than others as a source of pride. They like ripping the wings off of pixies, and like the pixies at first think that Smurfs turn into horrible monsters. The leader of the Wartmongers is King Bullrush (voiced by Kenneth Mars ) who commands his minions to do his bidding."

Came about as a result of repeated Rugby League player polls in which Anasta was often nominated as the most overrated player by his peers.,"Came about as a result of Bella's penchant for employing the ""squirrel grip"" or ""Christmas handshake"" which involves firmly gripping an opponent's testicles during a tackle performed in the sport of Rugby League .",Because of his poor ball handling in a State of Origin match.,"Brogan took exception to being called Dick Head at Adelaide Airport by a heckler and punched the offender in the nose, he was subsequently fined by the AFL and Port Adelaide .",Derived from Cousins's after-hours work with the white powder.,Developed after Cousins declared himself clean and ready to resume his football career.,Often shortened to simply The Door or B.D.B. Elias.,Refers to a newspaper report; often said sotto voce to show Slaven's displeasure with the use of a German word.,Refers to one good tournament that Frommers had on clay. Ever after he was considered Australia's clay court specialist.,"Gasnier was fired from the 2004 New South Wales State of Origin team for leaving an obscene voice mail message on a woman's mobile phone after a 'bonding session'. The transcript of the phone message is as follows: ""Where the fuck are you? There's four toey humans in the cab and our cocks are fat and ready to spurt sauce. It's 20 to four...and you're in bed, fuck me. Fire up, you sad cunt ."" Roy and HG also shorten this nickname to variations such as ""the F.U.B."", ""fubby"" and ""the fubster"".","From an NRL Pog describing Gasnier's step maneuver as the Shimmy, Shimmy, Whoosh.","A reference to the frequent use of ""Dare I say"" as a preface to comments in Marks regular newspaper column which appears in the Daily Telegraph.","He can run hot and cold, or ""turn it on"" i.e. on-field violence. By extension, Geyer's younger brother Matt is ""Tap II"".",'Hitman' came about due to Roy & HG looking for a nickname for Hall to make his boxing debut under.,Another nickname that was developed for Hall's boxing career.,Constructed due to the lack of a fighting name for Haumono when he began his boxing career following his rugby league career.,"As a result of Hayne being knocked out momentarily after attempting to make a tackle in Game III of the 2008 State of Origin series , in which his head cannoned into his opponent's hip.","A reference to Hensby's laments in national newspapers that he was the ""forgotten man"" of golf.",Due to Hewitt's diminutive size.,"The latter title derived from an incident after his playing days, when Hill was caught stealing lobsters from pots that didn't belong to him, resulting in Hill facing the magistrates' court , where he his defence was that he ""didn't know what he was doing"".","A reference to an infamous incident during a 2001 NRL game when, in an attempt to unsettle the opposing team, Hopoate forcibly pushed his finger into the anuses of three opposing players. This led to speculation by Roy & HG that Hopoate may have in fact been acting as an unofficial proctologist and that he was doing the players a favour because his impromptu rectal examination may have detected early signs of serious illness.","Kemp is the former federal Minister for Arts and Sport (2001–2007) whose nickname parodies his halting manner of speech. In the final years of the series Kemp was often held up as a supposed model of excellence in his portfolio, usually by way of an unfavourable comparison with the current incumbent (e.g. ""This wouldn't have happened if The Eh-Eh Man was still in charge, Roy!""). On one occasion Roy summed up Kemp's distinctive facial hair (a beard without a moustache) by saying ""He's got that type of beard that says 'I'm a failed psychologist' "".","The nickname is because of Glenn's large, solid physique. Roy and HG have also called him ""Dr Death"". The United Kingdom 's The Sun newspaper once got this name wrong and called him ""The Brick with Ears"".","A reference to the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical. Wally Lewis's nickname is 'King Wally', making his team-mate Allan Langer the 'I'. Langer was usually referred to as ""Deborah Kerr"", the actress who played the ""I"" in the movie version with Yul Brynner.",A reference to Norman's drawn-out career.,A satirical reference to the fact that Mason's well-known propensity for aggressive behaviour was explained by the fact that he reportedly suffers from an autism spectrum disorder .,"Introduced due to the lack of a nickname for Mason, as compared to Captain Feathers and Stinkfist.","Other Roy and HG name variations include ""Beav"", ""The Flying Beaver"" and ""Leave it to Beaver"" along with ""Beaver Las Vegas"".",A poke at Menzies' relatively old playing age in the twilight of his career.,"A double reference, both to the media constantly promoting Philippoussis as a hidden threat in tennis tournaments, and also a play on Philippoussis's nickname 'The Poo'. Usually invoked with reference to the U.S. Open at Flushing Meadow.","O'Neill, who has a history of off-field misconduct, including two DUI charges and urinating under casino blackjack tables on two separate occasions, was involved in a 1999 pre-season incident which led to his South Sydney Rabbitohs being banned from a Dubbo hotel. Following years of personal and professional turmoil, O'Neill trashed the Dubbo hotel room by smearing the walls with faeces . A direct quote from the horse's mouth describing a further bad deed from the night was ""hey Schlossie , I just shat in your shoe"".","From an article in a local paper, in reference to his dominance in MotoGP , ""The Real Deal"" was used to describe Stoner as a genuine competitor for the Moto GP title.","From 2009 when the Sharks played a home game in Adelaide their media manager organised a radio interview for Ricky Stuart on FIVEaa &, for a joke, told the station that his name was Carlos Smearson. That lead to an introduction along the lines of, ""and now joining us it's the coach of the Cronulla Sharks NRL team, Carlos Smearson. Welcome to the show Carlos....""","Named after the Australian chocolate biscuit brand, Tim Tams .",A direct quote from a newspaper article.,"An acronym derived from the perception that the Formula One driver earned numerous ""DNF"" (did not finish) race results early in his Formula One career due to collisions or mechanical breakdowns.",Taken from Webcke (Web-key) to Website and Australia's largest internet service provider Telstra Big Pond.,A reference to the Sydney Funnel Web Spider .,"A reference to sports reporter Tim Webster, who has a habit of constantly introducing sporting celebrities using the term ""the man they call (first name)"".","A reference to Gosper's overly officious and self-righteous nature when it comes to matters concerning sport, particularly the Olympics ."

"Coined by Tom Lorenzin (author of ""1000+ The Amateur Astronomers' Field Guide to Deep Sky Observing"") to honor Deer Lick Gap in the mountains of North Carolina, from which he had especially fine views of the galaxy group.",Named for the fact it contains only three galaxies.,"It was named by Halton Arp and Barry F. Madore , who compiled A Catalogue of Southern Peculiar Galaxies and Associations in 1987.","Named after its discoverer, Carl Seyfert . At the time it appeared to contain six external nebulae. It is also called the NGC 6027 Sextet , after its brightest member.","Named after its discoverer, Édouard Stephan ."
The galaxy group to which we belong.,"Also referred to as the NGC 7331 Group , after the brightest member of the group.",This small group of galaxies lies in the constellation Leo.,This stretch of galaxies forms part of the Virgo Supercluster .,This compact group of galaxies lies 160million light-years away in the Phoenix constellation.,"There are actually only five galaxies in the sextet, and only four galaxies in the compact group. One of the galaxies is an ungravitationally bound background object. The other ""galaxy"" is instead an extension of the interacting system — a tidal stream caused by the merger. The group is, therefore, more properly called HCG 79 ; the name refers to the visual collection and not the group. HCG 79 lies 190million light-years away in the Serpens Caput constellation.","There are actually only four galaxies in the compact group, the other galaxy is a foreground galaxy. The group is therefore more properly called HCG 92 , because the name refers to a visual collection and not a group. Thus, the real group is also called Stephan's Quartet"
