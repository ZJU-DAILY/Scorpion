# **Scorpion: Effective and Efficient Semantically Joinable Table Search via Pivot Columns**

Scorpion: an effective and efficient semantically
joinable table search framework powered by the pivot-column-based column embeddings. The proposed column embeddings are obtained from the column-to-pivot-column relationships captured by a lightweight approximate-graph-matching-based column mapping. To acquire good pivot
columns for guiding the column mapping process, a rank-aware contrastive learning paradigm is introduced.
